# Knight Travails

[PROJECT DEMO](https://dillondipetrillo.github.io/knight-travails/)

A program that finds the shortest path a knight can travel on a chessboard between two points on the board using a breadth-first-search algorithm.

## Usage

1. Select any spot on the chessboard to place a knight, or click the 'Randomlt Select' button to randomly place a knight.
2. Select the 'Select End Point' and click anywhere on the board to place where the knight should travel to.
3. Click 'Travail' to watch the knight move to the end point.
4. Select 'Clear' to start from the beginning.
